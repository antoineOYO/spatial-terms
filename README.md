# spatial-terms

We provide here a lexico-syntactic filter, based on Semgrex [1].
- `spatial_terms.ods` is the lexicon of spatial terms
- `mySemgrexPatterns.py` is the catalog of syntactic patterns
- `syntacticFilter.py` operates the joint lexical and syntactic search of patterns
- `myCorpusObjects.py` defines the main classes `sample` and `pattern` used in the code, explained next

> **Note**: `syntacticFilter.py` executes two main steps: `filter()` for pattern matching and `resolve()` for post-processing. The `resolve()` function is language-specific and handles disambiguation of overlapping matches.


### Inputs

Each input includes:  
1) a CoNLL-U formatted sentence  
2) a mandatory unique sentence identifier (used for downstream processing)

Inputs are structured into `sample` objects, minimally as:

```json
{   
    "conllu_str" : "1   The     the    DET    DT   Definite=Def|PronType=Art   4   det     _   _",
    "id" : "test0",
    "tokens" : ["The"],
    "text" : "The"
}
```
- `conllu_str` raw CoNLL-U string, optionally with `# text` and `# sent_id` metadata
- `id` : sentence identifier
- `tokens` : list of tokens extracted from the CoNLL-U
- `text` : sentence text (from metadata if present, else joined from tokens)

> **NOTE :** the code handles single CoNLL-U inputs with multiple sub-sentences (as it is often the case for bitexts).

### Output

Each match is returned as a `pattern` object, for example:

```json
{
    "conllu_str" : "1   The     the    DET    DT   Definite=Def|PronType=Art   4   det     _   _",
    "id" : "test0",
    "tokens" : ["The"],
    "text" : "The",
    "sub_sent_id": 0,
    "footprint": [1],
    "minimal_span": "The"
}
```
- `sub_sent_id`: sub-sentences index for disambiguation
- `footprint`: indices of matched nodes
- `minimal_span`: surface span ranging over the `footprint`

### Special Outputs for Basic Locative Constructions and Existential Statements

For BLCs and other complex spatial expressions, additional fields are included:
- `patternName` : the name of the pattern matched
- `figure` : the Figure text
- `st0` : "main" term of the preposition (see terminology in the code)
- `ground` : the Ground text
- `hash` a unique identifier for each found pattern (compiles `id`, `sub_sent_id`, `patternName` and `footprint`)
- `nodes` : a dictionnary {role:index} where the role is `figure`, `ground` etc

### Example : an Existential Statement
Input :
```txt
# sent_id = existantial-sample
# text = There is a prize on top of the wrapper.
1	There	there	_	EX	_	2	expl	_	_
2	is	be	_	VBZ	_	0	root	_	_
3	a	a	_	DT	_	4	det	_	_
4	prize	prize	_	NN	_	2	nsubj	_	_
5	on	on	_	IN	_	6	case	_	_
6	top	top	_	NN	_	4	nmod	_	_
7	of	of	_	IN	_	9	case	_	_
8	the	the	_	DT	_	9	det	_	_
9	wrapper	wrapper	_	NN	_	6	nmod	_	SpaceAfter=No
10	.	.	_	.	_	2	punct	_	SpaceAfter=No
```

Output :
```json
{
  "conllu_str": "...",
  "id": "existantial-sample",
  "tokens": [
    "There",
    "is",
    "a",
    "prize",
    "on",
    "top",
    "of",
    "the",
    "wrapper",
    "."
  ],
  "text": "There is a prize on top of the wrapper.",
  "sub_sent_id": 0,
  "footprint": [
    1,
    2,
    4,
    5,
    6,
    9
  ],
  "minimal_span": "There is a prize on top of the wrapper",
  "nodes": {
    "exist": 1,
    "verb": 2,
    "figure": 4,
    "st1": 5,
    "st0": 6,
    "ground": 9
  },
  "patternName": "existantial-en-complex-verb",
  "figure": "prize",
  "st0": "top",
  "ground": "wrapper",
  "hash": "existantial-sample:subsent-0:existantial-en-complex-verb:4-6-9"
}
```
